# My personal portfolio
Just change `src/portfolio.js` to get your personal portfolio. Feel free to use it as-is or customize it as much as you want. It's made to be very modular and be able to just take in values as props from one file, `src/portfolio.js`. Fork this repo and add more to it if you'd like!

#### Using Emojis

For adding emoji üòÉ into the texts in `Portfolio.js`, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.

## Deployment üì¶ 
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend to read through the [Deploying on Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.

#### Configuring GitHub Actions
- Using the Personal Access Token you placed in the `.env` file earlier create a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `OPEN_SOURCE_TOKEN` where the value matches the token value from the `.env` file in your local workspace.
- When you are done with the configuration, we highly recommend to read through the [Github Actions Configuring a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) docs.

#### Deploying to Github Pages

This section guides you to deploy your portfolio on Github pages.

- Navigate to `package.json` and enter your domain name instead of `https://example-portfolio.js.org/` in `homepage` variable. For example, if you want your site to be `https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio`, add the same to the homepage section of `package.json`. 

- In short you can also add `/portfolio` to `package.json` as both are exactly same. Upon doing so, you tell `create-react-app` to add the path assets accordingly. 

- Optionally, configure the domain. You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.

- Follow through the guide to setup GitHub pages from the official CRA docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).
